Summary of the Enhanced Flow:
User registers -> User ID is created
User browses product page
User places order -> Order Service receives user ID, product details
Order Service calls User Service -> User details (address, payment method) are fetched
User Service responds -> Order Service gets user details
Order validation & fraud checks (optional but industry-standard)
Inventory check (optional but important)
Order is processed -> Payment deducted, order confirmed
Order confirmation sent -> User notified (page, email, SMS)
Shipping updates (optional post-purchase interaction)
Post-purchase support (handling returns, exchanges, etc.)



Summary of Sync vs Async Communication
Step	Type of Communication	Explanation
User Registration	Synchronous	Immediate feedback to the user about registration success/failure.
Redirect to Product Page	Synchronous	Part of the HTTP request/response cycle.
Place Order	Synchronous	User expects immediate feedback on order processing.
Order Service Call to User Service	Synchronous	The order process depends on user details, which must be fetched immediately.
User Service Response	Synchronous	Immediate return of required user details (address, payment method, etc.).
Order Validation/Fraud Check	Synchronous	Critical real-time validation (e.g., payment validation).
Inventory Check	Synchronous	The order cannot proceed without knowing if the product is in stock.
Order Processing	Synchronous	Payment processing, updating inventory, and finalizing the order.
Order Confirmation & Notification	Asynchronous	Notifications and emails can be sent asynchronously after the order is processed.
Delivery Status & Shipping Updates	Asynchronous	Shipping and delivery updates can be triggered asynchronously via events or queues.
Post-Purchase Support	Synchronous	Customer service interactions usually require immediate responses.
